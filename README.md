🖥️ Simple Distributed System Simulator
📜 Project Description
A basic simulator of a distributed system where multiple nodes communicate and exchange messages asynchronously using multithreading and queues in C++.
This project simulates the message-passing protocol in a distributed network.

🚀 Features
Simulates multiple nodes sending and receiving messages.

Thread-safe message handling using mutex and condition variables.

Simple queue system for message management.

Extendable design for larger or more complex simulations.

🛠️ Technologies
C++11

Multithreading (std::thread, std::mutex, std::condition_variable)

Standard Template Library (STL)
